	<h1> 	Programming </h1>

		Here's a part of my projects and experiments 
	<p> 
		<ul>
			<li> 
				An experimental Forth virtual machine. This main purpose of this 
				project was writing a slow system enabling me to write a 
				fast compiler for my architecture directly from inside virtual Forth . 
				
				Another possible direction was extending it into a stack-oriented
				numerical system software with complex numbers and basic matrix functions. 
				Minimalism is fighting against the latter idea.
			
				Currently the virtual Forth system is about working. 
				(git repository coming soon)
