	<h1> 	Programming </h1>

		Here's a part of my projects and experiments 
	<p> 
		<ul>
			<li> (2025, ALPHA VERSION!!!)
		
			An experimental lisp system. It is written in pure C
			and demands nothing more than the input/output functions from the
			standard library of C.  Beware, this is an early release,  
			some known bugs have to be fixed.

			<li> (2025)
			The library developed during my master's degree thesis. It enables the simulation 
			of non-ideal finite time isothermal transformations of fermionic quadratic systems.
			It currently contains the necessary to simulate Otto and quantum Carnot cycles with
			an Ising chain as a working substance.  I will open a git repository as soon as I can.

			<li> (2025)
				An experimental Forth virtual machine. The main purpose of this 
				project was writing a slow system enabling me to write a 
				fast compiler for intel 8086 directly from inside Forth . 
				
				Another possible direction was extending it into a stack-oriented
				numerical system software with complex numbers and basic matrix functions. 

				Currently the virtual Forth system is incomplete but working. <br><br>
